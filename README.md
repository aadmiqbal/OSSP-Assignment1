# OSSP-Assignment1
Binary Search Tree in C



////
Hello all,

The assignment problem is now available at Assignment 1.pdf

For completing the assignment two additional files should be used, the header file bst.h and one test file test_bst.c

The assignment must be submitted as a well-documented piece of code in file "bst.c". The assignment will be graded in the virtual machine, therefore make sure that the command "gcc bst.c test_bst.c" runs without errors or warnings on the virtual machine

Kind regards - the team
